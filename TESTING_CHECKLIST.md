# HTTPS and Routing Fix Testing Checklist

## Deployment Status

-   ✅ Code pushed to GitHub
-   ⏳ Azure deployment in progress (wait 2-3 minutes)

## Testing Steps

### 1. Basic Homepage Test

-   [ ] Visit: https://techbuy-webapp-agbgf2gbgud8apaw.centralindia-01.azurewebsites.net/
-   [ ] Page loads without errors
-   [ ] Styling is applied correctly (Tailwind CSS)
-   [ ] No mixed content warnings in browser console
-   [ ] Check browser console (F12) for any HTTP resource loading errors

### 2. HTTPS Mixed Content Resolution

Expected fixes:

-   [ ] All CSS files load via HTTPS
-   [ ] All JavaScript files load via HTTPS
-   [ ] All image assets load via HTTPS
-   [ ] No "Mixed Content" errors in browser console
-   [ ] Lock icon appears in browser address bar

### 3. Laravel Routing Test

Test these URLs to verify routing works:

-   [ ] `/login` - Should show login page
-   [ ] `/register` - Should show registration page
-   [ ] `/dashboard` - Should redirect to login or show dashboard
-   [ ] `/products` - Should show products page (if it exists)
-   [ ] Any other routes your app has

Expected behavior:

-   [ ] No 404 errors for valid Laravel routes
-   [ ] Proper Laravel error pages for invalid routes
-   [ ] Navigation between pages works

### 4. Database Connectivity (if accessible)

-   [ ] User registration works
-   [ ] User login works
-   [ ] Any database-driven content displays

### 5. Performance Check

-   [ ] Page load time is reasonable
-   [ ] Resources load quickly
-   [ ] No console errors

## Troubleshooting Commands

If issues persist, you can run these in Azure SSH console:

```bash
# Clear all Laravel caches
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan cache:clear

# Recache for production
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache

# Check Laravel configuration
php artisan about

# Test specific routes
php artisan route:list
```

## Expected Results

-   ❌ Mixed content errors blocking CSS/JS
-   ❌ 404 errors on non-home pages
-   ❌ Unstyled homepage

### After Fix:

1. Check Azure App Service logs
