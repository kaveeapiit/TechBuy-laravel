git commit -m "feat: Complete nginx + php-fpm solution for Azure Laravel deployment

🎯 Comprehensive Azure nginx solution:
- Custom nginx.conf with Laravel pretty URL support
- Intelligent startup.sh script for automatic configuration
- Static asset optimization with caching headers
- Security rules for hidden files and sensitive directories
- PHP-FPM integration with performance tuning
- Health check endpoint for monitoring

🔧 Key features:
- try_files directive for Laravel routing (/login works without /index.php/)
- Static asset caching (CSS, JS, images) with proper headers
- Livewire and storage file handling
- CORS support for fonts and assets
- Gzip compression for performance
- Security headers and file protection
- Debug tool accessibility

🌐 This fixes all routing issues and optimizes performance!"
