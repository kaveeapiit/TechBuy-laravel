git commit -m "Fix Laravel structure for both local and Azure deployment

🏠 Local Development Fixes:
- Restore public/index.php with proper Laravel structure
- Restore public/.htaccess for local routing
- Enable Laravel development server (php artisan serve)

☁️ Azure Deployment Fixes:
- Smart root index.php that detects environment
- Serves from root in Azure, redirects to public locally
- Proper static asset handling for both environments

🔧 Structure:
- Local: Uses public/ directory (Laravel standard)
- Azure: Uses root serving with web.config routing
- Both: Share same codebase, different entry points"
