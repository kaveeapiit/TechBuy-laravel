# Contact Us & Pre-Order System - Issue Fixes

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Navigation Error - "currentTeam" on null**

**Problem**: Navigation menu tried to access `Auth::user()->currentTeam->name` when user wasn't logged in.

**Solution**:

-   Wrapped Teams Dropdown and Settings Dropdown in `@auth` blocks
-   Added `@guest` section with Login/Register links for non-authenticated users
-   Now navigation works for both logged-in and guest users

### 2. **Contact Page Layout**

**Problem**: Contact page was using dashboard layout (`x-app-layout`) instead of public site layout.

**Solution**:

-   Changed contact page from `<x-app-layout>` to `@extends('layouts.frontend')`
-   Now contact page matches the public site theme and navigation
-   Contact page is accessible to all users (guests and authenticated)

### 3. **Missing Footer Link**

**Problem**: Contact page wasn't linked in the footer.

**Solution**:

-   Updated footer in `layouts/frontend.blade.php` to link to contact page
-   Changed `<a href="#">Contact</a>` to `<a href="{{ route('contact.index') }}">Contact</a>`

### 4. **Missing Navigation Links**

**Problem**: Contact Us link wasn't in the frontend navigation.

**Solution**:

-   Added Contact Us link to main frontend navigation bar
-   Added Contact Us link to the app layout navigation (for dashboard users)

### 5. **Pre-Order Guest Access**

**Problem**: Pre-orders required authentication, but contact page should work for everyone.

**Solution**:

-   Removed `->middleware('auth')` from pre-order route
-   Modified ContactController to handle both authenticated and guest users
-   Updated form auto-fill to use `{{ auth()->user()->email ?? old('email') }}`
-   Different success messages for guests vs authenticated users

## ✅ **Current Status**

### **Public Contact Page** (`/contact`)

-   ✅ Accessible to all users (no login required)
-   ✅ Uses frontend layout matching the public site
-   ✅ Available in main navigation and footer
-   ✅ Auto-fills user data if logged in
-   ✅ Works for guests with manual input

### **Pre-Order Functionality**

-   ✅ **CREATE**: Anyone can submit pre-orders via contact page
-   ✅ **READ**: Authenticated users can view their pre-orders in dashboard
-   ✅ **UPDATE**: Authenticated users can edit pending pre-orders
-   ✅ **DELETE**: Authenticated users can cancel/delete pre-orders

### **Navigation**

-   ✅ **Frontend Layout**: Contact Us in main nav and footer
-   ✅ **Dashboard Layout**: Contact Us and My Pre-Orders in user menu
-   ✅ **Guest Users**: Login/Register links shown when not logged in
-   ✅ **Mobile**: All links work on mobile devices

## 🎯 **User Experience Flow**

### **For Guests:**

1. Visit `/contact` from home page navigation or footer
2. Fill out contact form or pre-order form
3. Submit pre-order without account
4. Get message suggesting to register/login to track orders

### **For Authenticated Users:**

1. Visit `/contact` with pre-filled user information
2. Submit pre-order easily
3. Access "My Pre-Orders" from user dropdown menu
4. Full CRUD operations on their pre-orders

## 🔧 **Technical Changes Made**

### **Files Modified:**

1. `resources/views/navigation-menu.blade.php` - Fixed auth guards
2. `resources/views/contact/index.blade.php` - Changed to frontend layout
3. `resources/views/layouts/frontend.blade.php` - Added contact links
4. `app/Http/Controllers/ContactController.php` - Handle guest users
5. `routes/web.php` - Removed auth middleware from pre-order route

### **Database Structure:**

-   **MongoDB**: `pre_orders` collection stores all pre-orders
-   **user_id**: Can be null for guest pre-orders
-   **PostgreSQL**: Users table remains unchanged

## 🚀 **Working Features**

### **Contact System:**

-   ✅ Public contact page with professional design
-   ✅ Contact form for general inquiries
-   ✅ Pre-order form for product reservations
-   ✅ Works for both guests and authenticated users

### **MongoDB CRUD Operations:**

-   ✅ **CREATE**: Pre-orders via contact form (all users)
-   ✅ **READ**: Pre-order dashboard (authenticated users)
-   ✅ **UPDATE**: Edit pre-orders (authenticated users)
-   ✅ **DELETE**: Remove pre-orders (authenticated users)

### **User Management:**

-   ✅ Guest pre-orders (no account required)
-   ✅ User pre-order tracking (with account)
-   ✅ Status management (pending → confirmed → processing → completed)
-   ✅ Email notifications ready (can be implemented)

The system now perfectly demonstrates dual database usage with complete CRUD operations on both PostgreSQL (products, users) and MongoDB (pre-orders), accessible through a professional public interface!
